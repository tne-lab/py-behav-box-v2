# Logging events

## Overview

The various parts of the Pybehave framework are connected through a single, unified event system. These events are relayed via
inter process communication between the Workstation, main TaskProcess, and Sources.

## Event objects

All events subclass the base *PybEvent* class which sets a number of flags to allow for serialization via the msgspec protocol. 
This class is heavily subclassed to represent numerous possible types of Events that could be leveraged by various tasks or external systems. 

### Task-related events

While events can be customized for specific needs, there are a few default Event classes that can represent the majority
of task information across systems. All task-related events subclass the base *TaskEvent* class which adds a
field representing the chamber the event is associated with. Events that happen during the task also have related timing information
and are represented by the *TimedEvent* subclass of *TaskEvent*. *TimedEvent* has two further subclasses, *StatefulEvent* and *LoggableEvent*,
that are used to forward events to the state-related task methods or event logging system respectively. A full overview of
the available subclasses is described below.

### Source-related events

An additional set of events are available specifically for communicating with Sources. Additional information on interacting
with these events is included in the Sources documentation.

## EventLoggers

EventLoggers handle *LoggableEvents* to complete desired tasks like serialization or forwarding to external systems. 
The core method of the EventLogger class, `log_events` will receive
the list of events produced by its corresponding task in the last event cascade. All EventLoggers will receive the full
list of events. Different logic cases can be written in the method to ensure EventLoggers only capture events of interest and vary behavior based on the *Event* subclass.
For example, the `OENetworkLogger` class has a case for handling `OEEvents` while all other EventLoggers do not.
An example `log_events` override for the core event types is shown below:

    def log_events(self, events):
        for e in events:
            self.event_count += 1
            if isinstance(e, InitialStateEvent):
                # Log for InitialStateEvent
            elif isinstance(e, FinalStateEvent):
                # Log for FinalStateEvent
            elif isinstance(e, StateChangeEvent):
                # Log for end of prior state
                self.event_count += 1
                # Log for beginning of new state
            elif isinstance(e, InputEvent):
                # Log for InputEvent
        super().log_events(events)  # Sometimes the super class method should be called

All EventLoggers have an `event_count` attribute for tracking the number of events that have been handled by the logger.
Additional EventLogger parameters for particular subclasses can be provided when added to the [Workstation](workstation.md).

### start, stop, and close

The EventLogger class also provides three additional methods that will be called when the task begins, ends, or is cleared: `start`, `stop`, and `close`.
These methods do not have to be overridden but the `start` method will reset `event_count` each time it is called.

### FileEventLoggers

FileEventLogger is a subclass of EventLogger with additional functionality for handling file saving. The `start` and `close`
methods of FileEventLogger ensure that files are opened and closed when needed. Additionally, the `log_events` method will flush
the file regularly if called by its subclass. To use a FileEventLogger, the user needs to override the `get_file_path`method
which will return the path to the file that should be saved. This path will then be used to open a file stored in the `log_file`
attribute. FileEventLoggers will default to saving to the *Desktop/py-behav-v2/TASK_NAME/Data/SUBJECT_NAME/DATE* folder which
is represented in the class by the `output_folder` attribute. An example override of `get_file_path` used by CSVEventLogger is shown below:

    def get_file_path(self):
        return "{}{}.csv".format(self.output_folder, math.floor(time.time() * 1000))
